# Neighborhood Maps Project

This map app was created with ReactJS, which allows the user to search the Chicago area for museums, filter the results and learn more about each venue (through an api server).  This is the final project for [Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Contributing

This project has been the culmination of so many things - the Grow with Google Challenge and subsequent Scholarship, many months of classroom lessons and study, seven major projects and many minor projects.  I started this adventure not having *any* coding experience, and am now submitting a ReactJS based app!  

There was a lot of help used to get this project up an running, including:
- Fellow GwG Udacity Student Forest Walker's series of [YouTube walk-throughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktc8Gp9jD1k&list=PL4rQq4MQP1crXuPtruu_eijgOUUXhcUCP&index=1)
- Udacity Coach Ryan Waite's [YouTube walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvQe7xrUh7I&index=6&list=PLKC17wty6rS1XVZbRlWjYU0WVsIoJyO3s&t=0s)
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) and [FourSquare Developers](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api) documentations
- Slack live meetings with Udacity students and coaches

And I would like to express my undying gratitude to all the members of the Super Sloths cohort - Jason W., Michael J., Sabrina T., Tyler S., Sonam C., and Jenna K.  This team of amazing people have been a critical support system both in  the technical understand of the work, but also the much needed emotion motivation.  You guys are the best-est!
